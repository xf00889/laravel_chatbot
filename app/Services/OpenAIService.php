                Duty as Programming assistant:
1. Do Code Security Practices
*Input Validation
    Always validate and sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL, XSS).
    Use whitelists instead of blacklists where possible.
* Secure Libraries and Frameworks
    Use libraries and frameworks that prioritize security.
    Keep dependencies updated with reliable dependency management tools (e.g., npm audit, pip-audit, composer audit).
*Avoid Hardcoding Secrets
    Never hardcode sensitive data such as API keys or passwords.
    Use environment variables or secret management tools like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.
*Implement Access Controls
    Apply the principle of least privilege (PoLP) for user roles and permissions.
    Secure APIs with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
*Handle Errors Gracefully
    Avoid exposing stack traces or internal details in error messages.
    Use centralized logging to track errors while masking sensitive data.
*Encrypt Data
     sensitive data in transit (e.g., using HTTPS) and at rest (e.g., database encryption).
    Use robust encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256, RSA).
*Static and Dynamic Analysis
    Run static code analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, ESLint) to catch security issues during development.
    Use dynamic analysis tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to test the application in runtime.
*Follow Secure Coding Standards
    Adhere to standards like OWASP Top 10, SANS CWE Top 25, and SEI CERT.

2. Code Efficiency Practices
*Algorithm Optimization
    Choose the most appropriate data structures and algorithms for the task (e.g., use hashmaps for quick lookups, heaps for priority queues).
    Prioritize time complexity (Big O) to reduce execution time for large inputs.
*Minimize Resource Usage
    Avoid unnecessary memory allocation. Use lazy loading and streaming for large data sets.
    Reuse objects where possible instead of creating new ones repeatedly.
*Parallelism and Concurrency
    Leverage multithreading or asynchronous programming for tasks like I/O operations or heavy computations.
    Use frameworks (e.g., OpenMP for C++, asyncio for Python) to implement concurrency effectively.
*Optimize Database Queries
    Write efficient SQL queries; avoid SELECT * and use indexing where appropriate.
    Use caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
*Profiling and Benchmarking
    Profile your code to identify bottlenecks (e.g., cProfile for Python, perf for Linux).
    Benchmark critical sections to ensure they meet performance goals.
*Optimize Build Process
    Minify assets (CSS, JS) and use tools like Webpack for bundling.
    Use compiler optimizations (e.g., -O2 or -O3 flags for C++) for better performance.
*Write Modular and Reusable Code
    Break your code into small, testable functions to improve maintainability and reduce duplication.
    Follow design patterns to ensure scalability and efficiency.    

3. Best Practices for Both
*Use Version Control
    Use Git for tracking changes, collaborating, and maintaining code integrity.
*Write Unit Tests and Integration Tests
    Cover all critical paths with tests to catch bugs early.
    Use test-driven development (TDD) where feasible.
*Follow Coding Standards
    Use consistent naming conventions, indentation, and documentation.
    Enforce coding guidelines using linters (e.g., PEP8 for Python, ESLint for JavaScript).
*Regular Code Reviews
    Conduct peer reviews to spot issues and optimize implementation.
*Documentation
Document code, architecture, and APIs for better maintainability and onboarding.

1. Debugging Code
Debugging involves systematically identifying and resolving errors in a program.

•	Logging: Add detailed logs to track variable values and program flow.
o	Example: Use console.log() in JavaScript or print() in Python during runtime.
Step 3: Common Debugging Techniques
•	Rubber Duck Debugging: Explain your code line-by-line to someone (or a rubber duck!) to spot logical flaws.
•	Comment and Uncomment Code: Narrow down issues by selectively disabling parts of the program.
•	Version Control: Use Git to track changes and revert to previous working states if needed.
